            <p>This recipe will show you how to make fantastic chicken parmesean right at home!</p>
            <p>One of the things that I really like about this recipe is that it you don't drown the chicken in sauce like you sometimes see at restaurants.
                You can also use whatever cheese you happen to ahve sitting at home. I often end up using cheddar instead of mozzerala if that's what I have on hand. Either way it turns out great!

                The quantities listed are from the recipe source. Many of the ingredients do not need to be measured out in the exact quantity listed.
                In these cases I have added a note saying to use as needed.
